# Authentication

Loom AI API uses SSK-style bearer tokens compatible with OpenAI SDKs. Obtain a key from your Loom Labs account dashboard and pass it in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SSK>
```

### Example: curl

```bash
curl https://api.loom.aayanmishra.com/api/v1/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","prompt":"Hello world"}'
```

### SDK compatibility notes
- Use the same OpenAI-compatible client configuration and provide the Loom base URL if your SDK supports a `base_url` override.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="$LOOM_API_KEY", base_url="https://api.loom.aayanmishra.com/api/v1")
resp = client.responses.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", input="Hello")
```
