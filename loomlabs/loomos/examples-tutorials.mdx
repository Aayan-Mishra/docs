## Examples & Tutorials

Examples included in the repository:

- `examples/quick_demo.py` — minimal demo
- `examples/weave_complete_demo.py` — WEAVE algorithm demo
- `examples/normal_usage_patterns.py` — usage idioms

Follow the code in `examples/` to run local demos and tests.

### Running the quick demo (step-by-step)

1. Start local cluster:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Install dependencies and run demo:

```bash
pip install -e .
python examples/quick_demo.py
```

3. Verify results:

- Confirm console output indicates training completion
- Use `loomos jobs list` to inspect job status

### WEAVE demo notes

- WEAVE demos can be compute-heavy. Use smaller node counts and reduced episode counts for local testing.

### Quick demo

`examples/quick_demo.py` demonstrates environment creation, WEAVE setup, and a short training loop.

### WEAVE Demos

`examples/weave_complete_demo.py` contains full WEAVE demos including Apollo-R1 multi-agent training.

### How to run examples

```bash
python examples/quick_demo.py
```
