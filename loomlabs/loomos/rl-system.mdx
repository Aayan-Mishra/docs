# LoomOS Reinforcement Learning System

The LoomOS Reinforcement Learning System provides a comprehensive, production-ready infrastructure for training, evaluating, and deploying reinforcement learning agents at scale. Built on distributed computing principles, it supports everything from simple single-agent environments to complex multi-agent systems with hierarchical objectives.

## Architecture Overview

The RL System is composed of four primary layers working in concert:

### 1. Environment Layer - LoomRL Gym
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Standardized interface for diverse RL environments
- **Environment Registry**: Centralized catalog of available environments and configurations
- **Custom Environment SDK**: Tools for creating domain-specific environments
- **Environment Versioning**: Track environment changes and maintain reproducibility

### 2. Algorithm Layer - Advanced RL Algorithms
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: State-of-the-art policy gradient method
- **WEAVE Algorithm**: Multi-objective RL with ensemble critics and weighted exploration
- **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)**: Off-policy algorithm for continuous control
- **Custom Algorithm Framework**: Plugin architecture for custom RL algorithms

### 3. Training Layer - Distributed Orchestration
- **Distributed Rollout Collection**: Parallel environment interaction across clusters
- **Gradient Aggregation**: Efficient parameter synchronization using NCCL
- **Experience Replay**: Scalable experience buffer management
- **Curriculum Learning**: Automated environment progression and difficulty adjustment

### 4. Evaluation & Deployment Layer
- **Policy Evaluation**: Comprehensive agent performance assessment
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different policy versions in production
- **Online Learning**: Continuous policy improvement from production data
- **Safety Monitoring**: Real-time policy behavior analysis and intervention

## Design Principles

### Reproducibility
- **Deterministic Training**: Consistent random seeds and deterministic operations
- **Comprehensive Checkpointing**: Save and restore complete training state
- **Artifact Provenance**: Complete lineage tracking in LoomDB
- **Environment Versioning**: Immutable environment snapshots

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distribute training across hundreds of nodes
- **Efficient Communication**: Optimized gradient aggregation and parameter broadcast
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Automatic resource allocation based on demand
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient experience replay and model storage

### Safety & Verification
- **Integrated Safety Checks**: Built-in policy behavior verification
- **Prism Integration**: Comprehensive safety and compliance validation
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automatic reversion to safe policies
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous policy performance tracking

### Loom RL Gym

The RL Gym exposes a consistent environment API and integrates with the rest of the platform for logging and metrics.

#### Environment Registry & Versioning
All environments are registered in LoomDB with full versioning and metadata. This enables reproducible experiments and audit trails.

```python
from rl import LoomRLGym, register_environment

register_environment(
	name="CustomTradingEnv",
	entry_point="trading_envs:TradingEnvironment",
	version="1.2.0",
	max_episode_steps=1000,
	reward_threshold=500.0
)
```

#### Custom Environment SDK
Create domain-specific environments using the SDK:

```python
from rl.envs import BaseEnvironment

class MyEnv(BaseEnvironment):
	def __init__(self, config):
		super().__init__(config)
		# ...
	def step(self, action):
		# ...
	def reset(self):
		# ...
```

Basic usage

<CodeGroup>
```python
from rl import LoomRLGym, EnvironmentType

gym = LoomRLGym()
math_env = await gym.create_environment(EnvironmentType.MATH, {"difficulty": "intermediate", "max_steps": 50})
state = await math_env.reset()
action = 0
next_state, reward, done, info = await math_env.step(action)
```
</CodeGroup>

### PPO Trainer

PPO implements clipped surrogate objectives with GAE and supports distributed updates across nodes. Key config knobs:

#### Distributed PPO
LoomOS supports distributed PPO with NCCL-based gradient aggregation and parameter broadcast. Example:

```python
from rl import PPOTrainer, PPOConfig

config = PPOConfig(
	learning_rate=3e-4,
	batch_size=4096,
	n_epochs=20,
	distributed=True,
	sync_frequency=100,
	log_interval=10
)
trainer = PPOTrainer(config)
await trainer.train(total_timesteps=10_000_000)
```

#### Advanced PPO Features
- Adaptive learning rate schedules
- Entropy regularization for exploration
- Early stopping and checkpointing
- Integration with LoomDB for experiment tracking

- learning_rate, batch_size, n_epochs, clip_epsilon, value_loss_coef, entropy_coef

Example configuration

```python
from rl import PPOTrainer, PPOConfig

config = PPOConfig(learning_rate=3e-4, batch_size=2048, n_epochs=10, clip_epsilon=0.2)
trainer = PPOTrainer(config)
```

### WEAVE algorithm

WEAVE (Weighted Exploration, Adaptive Value Estimation) provides hierarchical and multi-objective training. Use cases:

- Multi-objective reward shaping (safety, task completion, creativity)
- Ensemble critics for robust value estimation
- Node specialization across cluster for mixed objectives

Mathematical summary

```
π_WEAVE(a|s) = Σ w_i(s) * π_i(a|s)
V_WEAVE(s) = (1/Z) * Σ α_j(s) * V_j(s)
R(s,a) = Σ β_h * R_h(s,a)
```

### Distributed training patterns

- Data-parallel rollouts with centralized updates
- Parameter-server-less gradient aggregation (all-reduce/NCCL)
- Curriculum learning via environment progression

Troubleshooting & tips

- Monitor KL divergence to avoid policy collapse
- Use early stopping when validation reward stagnates
- Leverage LoomDB event traces to debug reward shaping issues
