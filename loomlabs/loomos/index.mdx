## Platform overview
LoomOS provides enterprise-grade infrastructure for AI model deployment, training, verification, and continuous improvement at scale. Below you'll find focused documentation for each major area of the platform — start with the Platform Overview or jump directly to the SDK, API reference, or deployment guides.

### How to use these docs

- Start with "Platform Overview" for architecture and quickstart
- Read "Core Modules" to understand LoomDB, Scheduler, and Security
- Use "SDK & CLI" for programmatic integration and job manifests
- Visit "API Reference" for endpoint and client details

### Verification checklist

- Follow the quickstart to run the demo
- Confirm LoomCtl responds: `GET /api/v1/cluster/status`
- Run an example training job and verify events appear in LoomDB

<Check>
Verify success by completing the Quick Start and seeing example outputs in `examples/`.
